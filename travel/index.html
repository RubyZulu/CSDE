    <h2>Flight Advice</h2>
         <p>
If you plan to drive around Scotland before or after the workshop, it would be best to get a car at the airport. If you search for car rental
via Google Maps they will direct you to rental places on the other side of the Clyde River - which might be ok if there was an easy way of 
getting across the river, but it's quite a distance. 
    <p>
        Two car rentals to consider in <a href="https://www.rentalcars.com/en/airport/gb/gla/">Glasgow</a> are Arnold Clark (there is a shuttle from the airport) and Enterprise  (walking distance from the airport)  
   <br>
        <a href="https://www.rentalcars.com/en/airport/gb/edi/">
            Edinburgh Airport</a>
   <p>
       Please bear in mind that Scotland's alcohol limit for driving is very close to zero. This means that even a beer will put
       you over the legal limit. The police regularly stop vehicles and will always breathalise, especially in the evenings. 
       <p>
          Also - there are strict laws around carrying knives. If you have a pocket knife with a blade longer than 3cm it
           would be best not to carry it on your person. 
       
    <h2>Travel Guide</h2>
    
    You might be able to fly to Edinburgh, or to Glasgow, whatever is most convenient. From both airports, you have two options for getting to the venue:
    <p><ol>
    <li> Public Transport from Edinburgh Airport:<br>
        <ul>
       <li> Take the tram from the airport to Haymarket Station. <br>
        <li> Catch the train to Glasgow<br>
     <li> Walk from the station<br>
        </ul>
        You might want to install the trainline app so you can check the schedule on the day<br>
        <img width="150" src="trainline.png">
        <p>
             <li> Public Transport from Glasgow Airport:<br>
        <ul>
       <li> Take the bus from the airport to Queen Street Station (buy a return ticket). <br>
        <li> Walk from the station<br>
        </ul>
       <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Queen+Street+Station,+Dundas+St,+Glasgow+G1+2AF/University+of+Strathclyde,The+Technology+and+Innovation+Centre,+George+Street,+Glasgow/@55.8610569,-4.2495413,16z/data=!3m1!5s0x488846a721005fe3:0xd8fdc01b33f3c9fa!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x4888441ffd832079:0x3bdaf84a05057e82!2m2!1d-4.2510943!2d55.8622754!1m5!1m1!1s0x488846a720405a25:0x27d11d6eb5d4fc89!2m2!1d-4.242905!2d55.8605248!3e2"> <img src="assets/directions.png" width="800"></a>
                 <p>
          <li> Drive:<br>
            Rent a car at the airport and drive. It would be a good idea to book this in advance, especially in June. Ask for automatic,
              because if you don't you will get a stick shift and have to prove that you are licensed to drive one. <br>
            Try to avoid driving during rush hour (before 9am and between 4pm and 6pm)
            </ol>

    <p>
        The workshop will be held at theTechnology & Innovation Centre, George Street, Glasgow, Scotland.

                 <h2>Health Insurance</h2>
                 This is a good idea if you're coming from outside the UK - the National Health Service is struggling at the moment.
                 
                 
                <h2>Electrical Devices</h2>
                 Our electricity is 230 volts, so be careful. Some of your devices might not work very well. Bring along an adaptor.
                 We use a three (flat) pin plug.
