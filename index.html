	    <h2>Workshop on Cyber-Securing Democratic Elections</h2>
    <p>
     The workshop is co-hosted by the University of Strathclyde and the the 
	    USC Election Cybersecurity Initiative at the University of Southern California. 
	    It will take place on June 27, 2023 in the 
	    <a href="https://www.strath.ac.uk/research/technologyandinnovationcentre/">Technology & Innovation Centre</a>, 
	    George Street,  Glasgow, Scotland.</p>
    <p>
	    The <a href="https://electionsecurity.usc.edu/">USC Election Cybersecurity Initiative</a>  is a new, non-partisan independent project at USC, supported by Google.  
	    It primarily aims to help protect campaigns and elections from digital and cyber threats.
	</p><p>
	    To this end, it has organised events in all 50 US states, as well as in Greece. 
	     These events are targeted toward people in and around campaigns and elections, including but not limited to: 
	academia, policymakers, election officials, candidates, and IT professionals. The events are also open to concerned citizens.
	    These events bring together academics and practitioners to share expertise on identifying and countering such threats. 
	</P><p>
	    This event at Strathclyde offers an opportunity to extend this approach, providing an opportunity for mutual learning between academics and practitioners in the UK, the USA and the EU.
</p><p>
The event’s primary objective would be raising awareness of the global and national cyber-security challenges, including in the UK and Scotland, and the technological contribution to meeting these challenges. We aim to integrate a range of disciplines in deep and meaningful ways, including the technological and science fields, social media, social science, and public policy. 
</p><p>
It could form a platform for further discussion between our Strathclyde and USC colleagues who are interested in research and educational opportunities in two areas:
<ul>

<li>	the technological dimensions of cyber security; and 
<li>	the social, political, and (mis)informational sciences.
</ul>

    </p>
    <p>
	    Importantly, the Initiative seeks to promote research at the intersection of technology and public policy, providing an opportunity to bring the academics more closely together to explore future engagement.
</p><p>
The event will bring together academics from a variety of
disciplines. Computer Science and Engineering are needed to understand
the technological threat related to recent developments in
communication and computing, including social media and artificial
intelligence.  Mitigations for these threats encompass both policy and
technical means.  We must consider the manifestation of these
technological threats through society, including their impact on
public opinion, consensus, electoral institutions, procedures, and
campaigns, and more generally on government institutions.  This
requires input by specialists in elections and political
behaviour. Understanding the strategic intentions of adversaries is
also important, requiring participation by those focused on
international relations and security.
<p>
Below we include lists of potential academic panelists, potential
speakers (mostly practitioners) and organisations to invite.</p>
