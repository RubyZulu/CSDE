    <h2>Workshop on Cyber-Securing Democratic Elections</h2>
    <p>
     The workshop is co-hosted by the University of Strathclyde and the the 
	    USC Election Cybersecurity Initiative at the University of Southern California. 
	    It will take place on June 27, 2023 in the 
	    <a href="https://www.strath.ac.uk/research/technologyandinnovationcentre/">Technology & Innovation Centre</a>, 
	    George Street,  Glasgow, Scotland.</p>
    <p>
	    The <a href="https://electionsecurity.usc.edu/">USC Election Cybersecurity Initiative</a>  is a new, non-partisan independent project at USC, supported by Google.  
	    It primarily aims to help protect campaigns and elections from digital and cyber threats.
	</p><p>
	    To this end, it has organised events in all 50 US states, as well as in Greece. 
	     These events are targeted toward people in and around campaigns and elections, including but not limited to: 
	academia, policymakers, election officials, candidates, and IT professionals. The events are also open to concerned citizens.
	    These events bring together academics and practitioners to share expertise on identifying and countering such threats. 
	</P><p>
	    This event at Strathclyde offers an opportunity to extend this approach, providing an opportunity for mutual learning between academics and practitioners in the UK, the USA and the EU.
</p><p>
The event’s primary objective would be raising awareness of the global and national cyber-security challenges, including in the UK and Scotland, and the technological contribution to meeting these challenges. We aim to integrate a range of disciplines in deep and meaningful ways, including the technological and science fields, social media, social science, and public policy. 
</p><p>
It could form a platform for further discussion between our Strathclyde and USC colleagues who are interested in research and educational opportunities in two areas:
<ul>

<li>	the technological dimensions of cyber security; and 
<li>	the social, political, and (mis)informational sciences.
</ul>

    </p>
    <p>
	    Importantly, the Initiative seeks to promote research at the intersection of technology and public policy, providing an opportunity to bring the academics more closely together to explore future engagement.
</p><p>
The event will bring together academics from a variety of disciplines. Computer Science and Engineering are needed to understand that technological potential of threats and how they can be addressed. It is also necessary to consider how these technological threats manifest themselves through electoral institutions, procedures and campaigns, which requires the input of specialists in elections and political behaviour. Understanding the strategic intentions of potentially malign actors is also important, which requires engaging people in international relations and security studies. Below we include lists of potential academic panellists, potential speakers (mostly practitioners) and organisations to invite.
